 * derived rather than stored — it is what the user actually perceives, and "125%" means more
 * to them than "level 1".
 *
 * The buttons exist because the keyboard shortcuts are invisible: the window has no menu bar,
 * so there is nothing to discover Ctrl+= from. Both routes drive the same main-process state
 * and this control follows along via onZoomChanged, so the readout stays correct no matter
 * which one the user reaches for.
